## Hey I'm Daniel

I'm a Masters student at University of Surrey studying Computer Vision, Robotics & Machine Learning, aspiring to be an Machine Learning/Computer Vision Engineer.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - Plant disease classification - Fine-tuning modern CV Models such as EfficientNet with fastai and using techniques such as cross-validation and ensembling to try and maximise accuracy, the model takes images of apple leaves and classifies whether they're healthy, have multiple diseases or have rust or scab.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Deepning my knowledge on PyTorch and Fast AI.
  - Improving my ML Engineering skills: building end-end products and using tools such as Docker.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
  - Computer vision projects involving things such as detecting, tracking and segmentation.
  - Satellite / disaster response projects (damage detection, mapping)
