## Hey, I'm Daniel 👋

I'm a Masters student at University of Surrey studying **Computer Vision, Robotics & Machine Learning**, aspiring to become a **Machine Learning/Computer Vision Engineer**.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - Plant disease classification
    - Fine-tuning modern CV Models such as EfficientNet with fastai and using techniques such as cross-validation and ensembling to try and maximise accuracy, the model takes images of apple leaves and classifies whether they're healthy, have multiple diseases or have rust or scab.
  - Football tracking & analytics
    - Building a computer vision pipeline to **detect and track players** from match footage, with the goal of extracting simple **performance and match statistics** such as heatmaps, possession etc.   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Deepning my knowledge on PyTorch and Fast AI.
  - Improving my ML Engineering skills: desinnging end-to-end ML products and using tools such as Docker, and preparing models for deployment.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
  - Computer vision projects involving things such as detecting, tracking and segmentation.
  - Satellite / disaster response projects (damage detection, mapping)
- 📚 Academic & theoretical background
  - Strong foundations in Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition with knowledge in tracking, segmentation, shape detection, deep learning, CNNs, Image Classification and detection.
  - Satellite Remote Sensing
